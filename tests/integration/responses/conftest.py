    When tests intentionally trigger errors, the server writes extensive error logs to stderr.
    Since stderr is piped to a subprocess buffer with limited pre-allocated memory, the buffer
    can fill up and cause the server's logging calls to block, making the server unresponsive.
    Most tests don't need to inspect server logs, so disabling the pipe prevents this deadlock.

    This runs before any fixtures, ensuring the server starts with stderr disabled.
