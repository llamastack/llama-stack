Despite its small size, Vatican City has its own government, currency, postal system, and even its own police force.\n\nInterestingly, Vatican City is also the headquarters of the Catholic Church and is home to numerous iconic landmarks, including St. Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, and the Vatican Museums.",
