It is an independent city-state located within Rome, Italy, and is home to the Pope and the central government of the Catholic Church.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for a country without an internationally recognized government or territory, there are several tiny territories that could be considered among the smallest:\n\n* Anguilla (a British overseas territory), which has an area of approximately 35 km\u00b2 (14 sq mi)\n* Prince Edward Island (Canada), which has an area of approximately 5,683 km\u00b2 (2,197 sq mi) and a population of around 147,000 people\n* Nauru (an independent republic), which has an area of approximately 21.3 km\u00b2 (8.2 sq mi)\n\nIt's worth noting that the definition of a \"country\" can be subjective, and there are many other territories and dependencies around the world that have different types of governance and claims to sovereignty.",
