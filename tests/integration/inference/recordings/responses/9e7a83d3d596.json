However, it's worth noting that true violets are actually purple in color, not blue. This phrase is a playful variation of the traditional \"Roses are red, violets are blue,\" which typically goes like this:\n\n\"Roses are red, violets are blue,\nSugar is sweet, and so are you.\"\n\nThis original quote has been used for centuries to make a lighthearted, whimsical compliment in poetry, songs, and spoken words."
