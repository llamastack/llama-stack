Moon: There have been several missions to the Moon in recent years, including lunar landings and establishment of a small research base.\n3. Other planets or dwarf planets: Some scientists have proposed plans for sending humans to other planets or dwarf planets like Enceladus (Saturn's moon) and Ganymede (Jupiter's moon).\n\nHowever, as of now, Earth remains the only known habitable planet with an atmosphere capable of supporting human life.",
