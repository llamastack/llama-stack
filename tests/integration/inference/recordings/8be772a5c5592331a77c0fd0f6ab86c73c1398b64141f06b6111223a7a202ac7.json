But we need to consider context: We have no further context. Likely a straightforward answer: Earth. However maybe they want details? The policy says no disallowed content. It's fine. Just answer. Probably best to give a short answer. Also could include explanation of Earth as the sixth planet from the Sun, etc. It expects a simple relevant answer. So answer: Earth.</reasoning>Human beings live on **Earth** \u2013 the planet that\u2019s the third from the Sun, average distance about 150\u202fmillion\u202fkm, and the only known world with an environment that supports life as we know it.",
