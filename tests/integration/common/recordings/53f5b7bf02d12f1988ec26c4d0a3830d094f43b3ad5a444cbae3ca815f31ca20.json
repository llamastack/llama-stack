Keep in mind that this is a limited environment, and you might not be able to push code or test more advanced use cases.\n\nHere are some tips for testing the CLIA model:\n\n* Use simple text inputs to get started.\n* Experiment with different queries and conversations to understand how the model responds.\n* Keep an eye on the model's limitations (e.g., it may struggle with complex questions or follow-up conversations).\n* Report any issues or concerns you encounter during testing.\n\nRemember that the test environment is designed for exploration and evaluation purposes only. Any data collected from the test environment will be anonymized and used solely for improving the CLIA model and other OpenAI products.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or need help with a particular test scenario, feel free to ask!",
