You can use:\n\n* A single question or statement\n* Multiple statements separated by commas\n* A prompt with a specific format (e.g., \"Write a short story about [topic]\")\n\n**Example Input**\n```\nAsk me: What is the capital of France?\n```\n\nGo ahead and choose your testing scenario, and I'll simulate the conversation!",
