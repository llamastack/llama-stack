# Llama Stack

## Llama Stack Overview

Llama Stack standardizes the core building blocks that simplify AI application development. It codifies best practices across the Llama ecosystem. More specifically, it provides

* Unified API layer for Inference, RAG, Agents, Tools, Safety, Evals, and Telemetry.

* Plugin architecture to support the rich ecosystem of different API implementations in various environments, including local development, on-premises, cloud, and mobile.

* Prepackaged verified distributions which offer a one-stop solution for developers to get started quickly and reliably in any environment.

* Multiple developer interfaces like CLI and SDKs for Python, Typescript, iOS, and Android.

* Standalone applications as examples for how to build production-grade AI applications with Llama Stack.

## Llama Stack Benefits

* Flexible Options: Developers can choose their preferred infrastructure without changing APIs and enjoy flexible deployment choices.

* Consistent Experience: With its unified APIs, Llama Stack makes it easier to build, test, and deploy AI applications with consistent application behavior.

* Robust Ecosystem: Llama Stack is already integrated with distribution partners (cloud providers, hardware vendors, and AI-focused companies) that offer tailored infrastructure, software, and services for deploying Llama models.
