## How to Use These Documents

### For New Team Members
1. Start with ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md (20 min read)
2. Read ARCHITECTURE_INSIGHTS.md (15 min read)
3. Bookmark QUICK_REFERENCE.md for later
4. Start exploring code using provided file paths

### For Understanding a Specific Component
1. Search QUICK_REFERENCE.md for the component name
2. Get the file path from ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md
3. Understand the context from ARCHITECTURE_INSIGHTS.md
4. Read the source code

### For Adding a New Feature
1. Identify which layer(s) you're modifying (API, Provider, Distribution)
2. Check ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md for similar components
3. Look at existing examples in the codebase
4. Use QUICK_REFERENCE.md for implementation patterns
5. Follow the extension points in ARCHITECTURE_INSIGHTS.md

### For Debugging Issues
1. Use QUICK_REFERENCE.md's debugging tips section
2. Find the routing mechanism in ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md
3. Trace through provider registration in ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md
4. Check the request flow diagram

## Key Takeaways

### The Three Pillars
1. **APIs** (`llama_stack/apis/`) - Abstract interfaces (27 total)
2. **Providers** (`llama_stack/providers/`) - Implementations (50+ total)  
3. **Distributions** (`llama_stack/distributions/`) - Pre-configured bundles

### The Architecture Philosophy
- **Separation of Concerns** - Clear boundaries between APIs, Providers, and Distributions
- **Plugin System** - Dynamically load providers based on configuration
- **Configuration-Driven** - YAML-based configuration enables flexibility
- **Smart Routing** - Automatic request routing to appropriate providers
- **Two Client Modes** - Library (in-process) or Server (HTTP)

### The Testing Revolution
- **Record-Replay Pattern** - Record real API calls once, replay thousands of times
- **Cost Effective** - Save money on API calls during development
- **Fast** - Cached responses = instant test execution
- **Provider Agnostic** - Same test works with multiple providers

### The Extension Strategy
Add custom providers by:
1. Creating a module in `providers/[inline|remote]/[api]/[provider]/`
2. Registering in `providers/registry/[api].py`
3. Using in distribution YAML

No framework customization needed!

## Important Statistics

- **27 APIs** covering all major AI operations
- **50+ Providers** across inline and remote implementations
- **7 Built-in Distributions** for different scenarios
- **Python 3.12+** required
- **100% Async** - Built on asyncio throughout
- **Pydantic** - For type validation and configuration
- **FastAPI** - For HTTP server implementation
- **OpenTelemetry** - For observability

## Most Important Files

These files are the foundation - understanding them gives 80% of the architecture knowledge:

1. `/home/asallas/workarea/projects/personal/llama-stack/llama_stack/core/stack.py` - Main orchestrator
2. `/home/asallas/workarea/projects/personal/llama-stack/llama_stack/core/resolver.py` - Dependency resolution
3. `/home/asallas/workarea/projects/personal/llama-stack/llama_stack/apis/inference/inference.py` - Example API
4. `/home/asallas/workarea/projects/personal/llama-stack/llama_stack/providers/datatypes.py` - Provider specs
5. `/home/asallas/workarea/projects/personal/llama-stack/llama_stack/distributions/template.py` - Distribution base

## Documentation Creation

These documents were created through:
- **Directory exploration** - Understanding the codebase structure
- **File analysis** - Reading key files across all components
- **Pattern identification** - Recognizing common architectural patterns
- **Relationship mapping** - Understanding how components interact
- **Testing analysis** - Understanding test architecture and patterns

All information comes directly from the codebase, with specific file paths provided for verification and deeper exploration.

## Staying Current

These documents reflect the codebase as of October 27, 2025. When the codebase changes:
1. Check if changes are in the identified key files
2. If in existing components, documents are still largely accurate
3. If entirely new components, documents should be updated
4. The architecture philosophy should remain constant

## Questions?

When exploring the codebase with these documents:
1. Start with the QUICK_REFERENCE.md for fast lookup
2. Use ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md for detailed information
3. Consult ARCHITECTURE_INSIGHTS.md for design rationale
4. Always verify with actual source code files

The documentation is comprehensive but code is the source of truth.
