    "### Use Cases Covered:\n",
    "1. **Two-Agent Conversation** - Teams working together on tasks\n",

      "### Explanation\n",
      "\n",
      "This function uses a regular expression pattern to match the general format of an email address. The `validate_email` function checks for the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The input is a string.\n",
      "*   There are no spaces in the email address.\n",
      "*   The email address matches the defined pattern, which includes:\n",
      "    *   One or more alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, pluses, or hyphens before the `@` symbol.\n",
      "    *   The `@` symbol.\n",
      "    *   One or more alphanumeric characters, hyphens, or dots after the `@` symbol and before the first dot in the domain.\n",
      "    *   At least one dot in the domain.\n",
      "\n",
      "If any of these conditions are not met, the function prints an error message indicating what went wrong and returns `False`. If all checks pass, it returns `True`, indicating a valid email address.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Error Handling\n",
      "\n",
      "The code includes proper error handling:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **TypeError**: Raised if the input is not a string.\n",
      "*   **Exception**: Catches any unexpected errors and prints an error message.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each error case provides informative messages to help with debugging.\n",
      "\n",
      "Review:\n",
      "**Code Review**\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the provided Python function for email validation looks clean and well-structured. It effectively checks if the input string matches the typical format of an email address using a regular expression pattern. However, there are some areas that can be improved upon:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Bugs and Edge Cases\n",
      "1. **Input Validation**: In the current implementation, `TypeError` is raised when the input is not a string, but then immediately caught and handled within the same function. Consider letting it propagate up instead of catching it here since you're already returning an error message and `False`.\n",
      "2. **Email Length Limitation**: The regular expression does not account for email length limits. As per [RFC 5321](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321#section-4.5.3), the maximum total length of a mailbox (local part plus domain) is 320 characters, but some mail servers may enforce shorter limits.\n",
      "3. **Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)**: The function does not support IDNs which are domain names that contain non-ASCII characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Performance Issues\n",
      "1. **Regular Expression Compilation**: If this function is called frequently, compiling the regular expression pattern once outside of it and storing the result in a variable can improve performance.\n",
      "2. **Exception Handling Overhead**: Python exceptions come with some overhead. Using if-statements to handle anticipated conditions (like type checking) instead of using exceptions for control flow might be more efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Security Vulnerabilities\n",
      "No significant security vulnerabilities were identified, but it's essential to note that validating an email address does not necessarily mean the provided email exists or can receive mail; a separate verification process (usually involving sending a confirmation link) should be implemented if you need to confirm the existence of the email account.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Best Practices\n",
      "1. **Direct Printing**: Instead of directly printing error messages from within the function, consider raising exceptions with descriptive messages. This approach allows the caller to handle errors as needed.\n",
      "2. **Variable Naming and Comments**: Although comments are provided in the docstring and around code blocks explaining what each segment does, variable names like `email` could be more descriptive (e.g., `input_email_address`). However, given the context, `email` is sufficient here.\n",
      "3. **Example Usage**: The example usage section provides a simple demonstration of how to use the `validate_email` function with different inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Code Improvements\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import re\n",
      "\n",
      "EMAIL_PATTERN = re.compile(\n",

      "        print(\"-\" * 50)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while the original code provides a good basic structure for validating email addresses, a few adjustments can enhance its flexibility and robustness. These changes primarily focus on improving exception handling, avoiding unnecessary overhead, and adhering to best practices in Python coding standards.\n",
