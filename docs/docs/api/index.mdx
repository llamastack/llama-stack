**Supported Providers:**
- Brave Search (Hosted)
- RAG Runtime (Single Node)

## API Compatibility

All Llama Stack APIs are designed to be OpenAI-compatible, allowing you to:
- Use existing OpenAI API clients and tools
- Migrate from OpenAI to other providers seamlessly
- Maintain consistent API contracts across different environments

## Getting Started

To get started with Llama Stack APIs:

1. **Choose a Distribution**: Select a pre-configured distribution that matches your environment
2. **Configure Providers**: Set up the providers you want to use for each API
3. **Start the Server**: Launch the Llama Stack server with your configuration
4. **Use the APIs**: Make requests to the API endpoints using your preferred client

For detailed setup instructions, see our [Getting Started Guide](../getting_started/quickstart).

## Provider Details

For complete provider compatibility and setup instructions, see our [Providers Documentation](../providers/).

## API Stability

Llama Stack APIs are organized by stability level:
- **[Stable APIs](./index.mdx)** - Production-ready APIs with full support
- **[Experimental APIs](../api-experimental/)** - APIs in development with limited support
- **[Deprecated APIs](../api-deprecated/)** - Legacy APIs being phased out

## OpenAI Integration

For specific OpenAI API compatibility features, see our [OpenAI Compatibility Guide](../api-openai/).
