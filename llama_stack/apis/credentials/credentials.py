    Credentials are ephemeral -- they may be purged after the specified TTL.

    Credentials are associated with the logged in user. If no user is logged in, the credentials
    are associated with the anonymous user.

    It is recommended to store these credentials using Envelope Encryption. The storage could
    be a regular KVStore, but you should use a secure Key Management Service for encrypting
